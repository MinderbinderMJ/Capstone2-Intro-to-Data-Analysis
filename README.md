# Capstone for Introduction to Data Analysis Intensive Course

PROJECT NAME:  Study of Endangered Species in National Parks 2018

DESCRIPTION:  This project was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of the Codecademy's Intro to Data Analysis Intensive Course using provided data, prompts, and concepts.
Ostensibly, this is a study detailing the overall impact of conservation interventions on species in several studied national parks in the US; however, the data used was provided and probably simulated.  Thus, the findings of the presentation are not useful in real-life.
